I was working on some Blender modeling a bit ago, just to get used to some tools, etc. The attempt really wasn't to be a photo-realistic render, obviously. It was just to help me get into some of the tools a bit more. The result isn't too bad.

Modeled in Blender. Rendered with Blender Internal.

I haven't gotten into Cycles yet ...
