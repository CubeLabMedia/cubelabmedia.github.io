<a href="http://www.cubelabmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/doorwayRender.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-185" alt="doorwayRender" src="http://www.cubelabmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/doorwayRender-300x168.png" width="300" height="168" /></a>I was working on some Blender modeling a bit ago, just to get used to some tools, etc. The attempt really wasn't to be a photo-realistic render, obviously. It was just to help me get into some of the tools a bit more. The result isn't too bad.

Modeled in Blender. Rendered with Blender Internal.

I haven't gotten into Cycles yet ...
