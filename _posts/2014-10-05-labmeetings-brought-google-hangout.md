Jon Price and I (Tadd) decided to give a new thing a try. With the way life in general seems to be pretty chaotic, using the awesome features of Google Hangout to have an Official Lab Meeting was a perfect way to start figuring out the next steps for 'The Lab', our projects, and chat with fans. Well, mostly just us.

It was an experiment. And while it was rifeÂ with issues from the start, we managed to get it rollin!

So, please enjoy!
