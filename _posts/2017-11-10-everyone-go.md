It&#8217;s 2015, and CubeLab Media seems to be M.I.A &#8211; doesn&#8217;t it? The last official post was in November, and according to our LabMeetingsÂ (you are watching these, right?) we said we plan on doing more.

## So where are we?

Well, Jon went and, on December 9, presented code and information at GRDevNight on how to create a procedural generated map. Sadly, I wasn&#8217;t there due to family emergencies, but from what I&#8217;ve been told he did an awesome job.

We&#8217;re slowly, but surely, posting more videos on our YouTube channel. So if you&#8217;re not subscribed, please do so. Makes sure that you don&#8217;t miss anything, and it also encourages us to keep on fighting!

Our up and coming game, MARCUS, is still in the works. You can see some of the things being created in the last recorded LabMeeting. We&#8217;re really starting to build some pretty awesome stuff. So keep your weathered eye on the horizon!

So we&#8217;re still here. Just hanging out back stage. We&#8217;ve been trying to update our Twitter account @cubelabmedia every so often so you know we&#8217;re still alive.
