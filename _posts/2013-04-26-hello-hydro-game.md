It's about time that I went from "just playing around" to creating something to be played. So, I've started working on my first game - coming sometime - called:

## HELLO, HYDRO!

H,H will be a platform style game ala Super Mario Brothers created for desktop computers (Win and Mac).

This simple, fun game will be released in chapters and will feature a cute robot, tricky jumps and more.

I'm really excited to create this and have already started prototyping it out. Hopefully I'll be able to show something more in the near future!
