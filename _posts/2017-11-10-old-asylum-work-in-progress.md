I decided to start a new project in Blender today. I found a pretty awesome photo by &#8220;Project Mayhem&#8221; from historical Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in West Virginia. The picture is really lovely.

So I couldn&#8217;t help myself but to open up good ol&#8217; Blender and try to model it out in 3D.

I started by examining the image for a while. There is a lot of little details to the scene, such as broken doors and window frames, that really make the image feel sad, but beautiful. I started doing small things first (walls, windows, ceiling) and I&#8217;m now adding details such as the light switch and wire conduits. The lighting in the end will make or  break this render, so I&#8217;ll be playing around with that in the near future.

This is a work in progress, and so far I&#8217;m enjoying the progress.
