For a while I've had this idea to have a game where you're popping a bunch of grouchy, angry, bitter balloons. I was planning on making it for mobile devices. The idea was to get rid of all bitterness, malice, anger ... you know the drill.

Sometimes it just doesn't happen.

But I made a prototype I'm fairly proud of. You can play it on your browser, so you don't need your phone for this. Sadly, the software I built it in doesn't natively publish APK for Android anymore. Lame. BUT, this is a prototype. So .. enjoy.

Give it a look and have fun popping some angry looking balloons!
