So we realize that we've been very absent of late. Some may even wonder if we're even working on anything anymore, if we've died, if aliens abducted us and then after being annoyed with us left us stranded on a planet  billions of light years away to battle giant insects to the death.

<strong>Fret not, Interns. We are not lost!</strong>

It's been a busy summer, that's for sure. However, we've been hot on the heels of some big CubeLab Media projects and endeavors, looking forward to growing the laboratory exponentially! We're not sitting idly by whilst time slips away. Nay, I say! Never!

<strong>What does that even mean?</strong>
<ul>
	<li><em><strong>More LabCasts!</strong></em>
You heard right - MORE LabCasts! We have one under our belt (featuring yours truly) but we want to do more! We're planning more!</li>
	<li><em><strong>New shows!</strong></em>
Yes, you read that bulleted point above - NEW shows. We have so many ideas literally bursting from our heads! It's gross! Brain matter everywhere ... clean this up intern!</li>
	<li><em><strong>Finishing Air Aahhh!!!</strong></em>
One of our greatest hopes is to do games. It's been a dream of ours since ... well ... remember dinosaurs? Before those guys. <em>Air Aahhh!!!! is coming!</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Moar gamez!</strong></em>
Right .. more. MORE .. we have a lot to do!</li>
</ul>
And so many other projects and ideas we've been scheming! This has been a busy summer!

We are also working on revamping our website so that it is a better showcase of projects and such. Look for this to happen in the next week as we start gearing up.

The next LabCast will soon be ready. One way or the other, it will happen! We're planning to make this a regular thing. We're geared up to put these on iTunes and other podCast sites (as well as keeping it on YouTube) for your consumption.

So, while we may not be very chatty lately, we are moving and shaking!

Until we talk again,
Tadd
Head Lab Technician
