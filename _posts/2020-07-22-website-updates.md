In the coming days and weeks the CubeLab media website will be performing a series of updates. Nothing yuge, really. But I'm going to create some new pages, style some old pages, and give a proper facelift.

### Better for mobile

One change will be I'm trying to make this website better for mobile usage. Understanding the statistics is vital. And I understand that people are going to check this website on a phone or tablet (do people still use tablets?) just as much as their laptops and desktops. 

### Moar contents!

Also, I'm hoping to post some basic updates to this website at least monthly. Yeah, that's not a lot in the greater scheme of things, but it's better than nothing.

### Stay tuned ..

More is coming. Some music updates, and videos, and and and. But that will be for another day. Or even .. a [podcast](https://anchor.fm/thelabcast){:target="_blank"}.
