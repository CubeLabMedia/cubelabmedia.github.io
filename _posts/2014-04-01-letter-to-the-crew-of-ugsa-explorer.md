<em><strong>Congratulations, Crew of UGSA Explorer!</strong></em>

On behalf of the entire human race, we want to thank you for your dedication and passion for exploring the stars. Our world is in peril. After hundreds and thousands of years, we need a new source of life. A new Earth.

That is your mission, Explorer.

While our home parishes, our attempts to Terraform other planets within the Milky Way has gone unsuccessful, and humanity is reaching an unprecedented genocidal catastrophe. With our air polluted, water and other natural resources depleted, everything is dying.

This is a race with time! You few are the first to venture out of our reaches. Beyond the edges of mapped space, where no human has ever ventured. You are the first to fly in <em>The Explorer,</em> a united venture of all Earth, to explore the reaches of space.

This is science fiction made reality.

Now go. Be safe. Return soon. We will look to the stars for your return.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Wilson
United Global Space Administration President
