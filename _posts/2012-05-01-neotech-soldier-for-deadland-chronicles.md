I'm excited. Why? Because I finally am feeling like there is true movement for Deadland Chronicles. Something more than usual.

Displayed is the first test render of a rigged character, one of the antagonists you'll see through the story. It's called a NeoTech Soldier. It's not good news. But it's going to be a crazy, killa.

I'm excited. Can you tell?

Modeled in Blender and rendered in Daz Studio.
