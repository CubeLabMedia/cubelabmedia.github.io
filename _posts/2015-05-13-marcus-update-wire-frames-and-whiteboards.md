We're not afraid to admit that we're pretty new to this game development realm. We're web developers and designers. It's a whole new beast, creating a video game.

What we can say is planning a video game can be like making an enterprise level web site. You still have to do an information architecture. You still need to whiteboard ideas out. Not committing them to a design file or code right away. You still need to wire frame these ideas with primitives as a proof that they will work.
<h3>Knowing Software</h3>
We know MARCUS pretty well now. It's been  talked about, examined, and re-examined. We played around with <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a>, and before that <a href="http://unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unity3D</a>. I'm comfortable with <a href="http://blender.org" target="_blank">Blender,</a> <a href="http://inkscape.org" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>, and <a href="http://krita.org" target="_blank">Krita</a> (to an extend).

We're feeling more confident in our abilities. So now, it's time to roll up our sleeves and <em>do</em> something. Life tends to cause us trouble, true. That's the go-to excuse.
<h3>Making Plans</h3>
As you see, we have some lists and plans. I'll be creating some simple wire frames in Google Draw to help Jon and I be on the same page. It will be rudimentary and ugly. It's all about function. That is what we need to iron out. How is the main menu going to lay out, and what options should/could be available? What about the in-game HUD (Heads Up Display)? There are things we need to layout <em><strong>BEFORE</strong></em> we get too far into the game. Otherwise it will be a lot of "Well that looks like crap now .. we need to figure out how to change it" moments. Those are annoying.

So keep an eye out. More things will be posted here on the website as well as the official <a href="http://twitter.com/cubelabmedia" target="_blank">CubeLab Media Twitter account</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAUwg6U-j1vJ5qRzLddd3jodWv-v5EypQ" target="_blank">LabMeetings</a> will probably start back up very soon, as well as perhaps some live wire frame sessions and more. So be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CubeLabMediaVideos" target="_blank">subscribe to our YouTube channel</a> as well.

It's been a slow time, but we're getting there!
