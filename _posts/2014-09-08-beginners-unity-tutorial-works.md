We've been quiet at the lab for a while. This is because we're hard at work on bringing you, Interns, something fun!

Jon, a fellow Lab Tech here at CubeLab Media, has been hard at work building what we can only call a great beginners guide into building a simple game in <a href="http://unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unity</a>. He spent a few hours testing out his method and will be building this fantastic tutorial for your future consumption!

If you've not done it already, go over to our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CubeLabMediaVideos" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> and subscribe! We're going to roll some great stuff out this fall and we don't want you to miss it!

Jon is really excited to create this tutorial! Stay tuned, friends!
