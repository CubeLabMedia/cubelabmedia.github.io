I've not been good. I've been, actually, very bad. And not been very committed to updating this website, nor on doing what I said I was going to do. Be more creative.

That's not acceptable.

I have, however, been messing around with ideas in Unity and Construct 2. Creating stupid little tests and prototypes. One of my Lab Assistants (my son) asked me why I don't put those out there for people to try out.

And gosh darn it! He's right!

So, in the very near future, I'll be posting the first playable prototype for a game. As in, as soon as I can export it and get it on this website. It will be an HTML5 game so it should work on all modern browsers. 

Sorry, ya'll. I'm not good at this communication thing ...
