I've been working on Deadland Chronicles, a graphic novel make in CG. The two programs I'll be using are Blender and Daz Studio.

It's been a challenge to learn software. But it's also been enjoyable.

Here is an example of what I'm working on.

For those interested, this is what you need to do:

Step One) Export a Daz model as a Maya OBJ.

Step Two) Import into Blender

Step Three) Model your clothing around the model.

Step Four) Export as OBJ

Step Five) Import into Daz Studio

More to come about how to attach the clothing to your model!
