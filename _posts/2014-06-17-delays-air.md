Our first experiment, titled <em><strong>'Air AAHHH!!!!</strong></em>' is being delayed a few weeks due to previous engagements. Much is already completely, but there are still things to iron out. Â We're disappointed, but still excited to see this reach fruition.

The game is planning on being released initially for Android devices and in time for iOS and perhaps Windows 8 mobile.

In the mean time, please enjoy this delightful track by musician <a href="http://ryosa.com" target="_blank">Henrik Ryosa</a>:
