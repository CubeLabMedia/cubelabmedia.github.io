I decided to start a new project in Blender today. I found a pretty awesome photo by "Project Mayhem" from historical Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in West Virginia. The picture is really lovely.

So I couldn't help myself but to open up good ol' Blender and try to model it out in 3D.

I started by examining the image for a while. There is a lot of little details to the scene, such as broken doors and window frames, that really make the image feel sad, but beautiful. I started doing small things first (walls, windows, ceiling) and I'm now adding details such as the light switch and wire conduits. The lighting in the end will make or  break this render, so I'll be playing around with that in the near future.

This is a work in progress, and so far I'm enjoying the progress.
