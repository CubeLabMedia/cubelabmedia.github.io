It&#8217;s already a quarter through 2014 and there has been little or no news from the lab. It&#8217;s as if a black hole spontaneously opened and sucked up all the projects, leaving no news or updates!

Well, in a way that is what happened. Minus the cosmic event.

Things of the personal nature has caused all the wonderful projects on the &#8220;to do&#8221; list to be pushed back. It&#8217;s a bit frustrating, but that&#8217;s life.

So, small updates per projects:

## Deadland Chronicles

This project is huge. It&#8217;s going to take some time. I&#8217;m tweaking, revisiting, tweaking, revisiting the script trying to get it right. It will come. What form, who knows. It could stay as a graphic novel/comic, be a written novel or hey, maybe an animated series. Time will tell. But this story is dear to me and won&#8217;t be left alone for long.

## Hello, Hydro

Mobile games are the future! And they&#8217;re here today! Which, means .. they&#8217;re really the present and &#8230;

This is still in the works. I&#8217;ve been slowing building up my code base so when it comes time to rollin everything out I&#8217;ll be on top of it. This will be primarily a game for your smartphones and tablets &#8211; so get your game face on.

## Bitter Balloons

Oh, these darling little air filled bundles of grouchy joy!

We (Jon [Jerboa Studios] and Tadd) are still hard at work on this, but with time cut short by prior obligations we had to step back, take a breather and regroup. We&#8217;re still excited for this project, we thing it&#8217;s going to be one heck of a game! Who doesn&#8217;t want to get rid of their grouchy little balloons!?

## Other writings and games

OK, anyone who knows me(Tadd) knows I have dozens of ideas for other projects that I keep tucked away in what passes for my brain. Also, Evernote. So where are these in the greater scheme of things?

To be fair to the previously mentioned projects I&#8217;m putting a lot of my future dreams and aspirations on hold for now. Other than taking notes to expand whatever world I&#8217;m creating for said story. I love writing. I love exploring new possibilities. Until I have time, they&#8217;ll have to be put on a shelf, only to be admired from afar.

### In Conclusion

So you see, the lab is still in full effect. However, 2014 has shown some unwanted surprises and we had to pull back a little before we&#8217;re completely overwhelmed.

Our beakers are burning. The lab is still open.

Scientifically Yours,

Prof. Tadd
