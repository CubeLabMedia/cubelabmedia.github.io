Ok, so I've been a pretty big failure lately. I've been wanting to be more creative the last several months, and really all Iv'e created is .. well, nothing that you've obviously seen!

### BUT WAIT!

I did create something that I want to share with all of you. I decided to st ep up, step out, and do something new.

## Introducing: WRITE BOX!

This is a podcast that is here to encourage writers, particularly though of the Dungeons & Dragons persuasive. The end goal is to help you, fellow creatives, to be more apt to write, create, and be more fruitful in your endevours. I know I could use the encouragement, so why not encourage you!?

It's free to listen to. Let me know what you think!

And hopefully so many more platforms! In the next few days (or weeks) I'll be recording more, as well as making a dedicated page here on CubeLab Media for this project.

I'd really apprecaite if you spread the word about it. This helps encourage me to do more!

So again, let me know what you think!
