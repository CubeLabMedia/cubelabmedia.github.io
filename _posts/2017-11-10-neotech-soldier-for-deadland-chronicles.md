I&#8217;m excited. Why? Because I finally am feeling like there is true movement for Deadland Chronicles. Something more than usual.

Displayed is the first test render of a rigged character, one of the antagonists you&#8217;ll see through the story. It&#8217;s called a NeoTech Soldier. It&#8217;s not good news. But it&#8217;s going to be a crazy, killa.

I&#8217;m excited. Can you tell?

Modeled in Blender and rendered in Daz Studio.
