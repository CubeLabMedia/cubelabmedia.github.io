Let&#8217;s be honest here. You already knew we&#8217;re all over the map. It&#8217;s not like this is new.

Jon and I have been hard at work. Not productive on what we _want_ to do, but hard at work. We have a 9-5 day job that takes a lot of our creative and cognitive energy. We have families that we want to be sure to spent time with. We&#8217;ve both experiences life-sucking zombie-colds that just won&#8217;t leave us alone.

Then, Epic&#8217;s Unreal engine launched with their new, free, option. CubeLab Media announces abandoning Unity3D, and begins the process anew (See: LabMeeting &#8211; March 6). So, we&#8217;ve just been super swamped! We&#8217;re starting to get our bearings. It will take a bit to learn Unreal Engine, transfer models, and rebuild maps. It&#8217;s already looking pretty dang awesome, but it&#8217;s still slow going.

If you want to support us, please follow us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube .. we could use that support and would be a tremendous encouragement us.

So, we&#8217;re sorry. We&#8217;re not trying to be slow. But this is worth it and you&#8217;ll love us at the end.
