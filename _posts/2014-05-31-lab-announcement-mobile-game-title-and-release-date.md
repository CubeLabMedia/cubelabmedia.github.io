Since games became a household item we've spent uncounted hours pounding on keyboards, gripping joysticks or clutching unwieldy controllers. We've watched PacMan eat white dots, running from ghosts. We've helped defend the world from space invaders. We've found where in the world was Carmen Sandiego. We've fought terrorists, brought down Big Daddy's, run through dark elves and orcs. We played games and delved into these digital worlds without abandon. Sometimes to the dismay of a wife or child or parent, but we played. It was our world, our way.

So, it is with great excitement that we here at CubeLab Media announce our first game: <em><strong>Air AAHHH!!!!</strong></em>

<em><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-503" src="http://www.cubelabmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/airaahhh-posterimg.jpg" alt="Air AAHHH!!! Coming soon" width="1024" height="923" /></strong></em>

This game is a simple, mobile game that will beÂ available tentative by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">end of June</span>. Starting on Android devices and within browsers, we hope to move it into iOS devices shortly after.

It is designed using Blender3D and Inkscape. The game is being put together using Unity in it's amazing 2D mode.

This game is free, unlimited, and hopefully will be tons of fun.

The end of June will come quickly, but we've been excitedly working away on this project all through May. Assets are 80% created, code is being hashed out as I write this, and music provided by the great <a href="http://ryosa.com" target="_blank">Henrik Ryosa</a>.

<strong>Keep your eyes on the sky!</strong>
