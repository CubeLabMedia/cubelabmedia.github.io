I&#8217;ve been struggling on the &#8220;hair front&#8221; for the graphic novel, Deadland Chronicles, for some time. I&#8217;ve bounced around from using all Blender to Daz Studio to makeHuman &#8230; nothing seemed to work for the longest time.

Happily, I&#8217;ve gotten further on this than I hoped. Here is a short progression of tests.

**FIRST TEST**

This was a test as I was planning on using Daz Studio. So I needed a mesh=rendered hair. Not the best &#8230; actually, it&#8217;s pretty embarrassingly bad.

**SECOND TEST**

This was taking what I tried in my previous and make it work better. The result, while not ideal, did give me some hope that I wasn&#8217;t wasting time. Using Blender.

**THIRD TEST**

Trying to use a hair technique used by Henrik Ryosa in his upcoming project, Brute, the result was albeit interesting but really not what I was looking for. It did, however, push a few of my Blender skills a bit and helped me to learn a few new tools that I didn&#8217;t know Blender had.

This was simply put extruding faces individually, smoothing and closing the ends to make big chunks. Finally, using the cloth modifier to make it fall.



**FINAL TEST**

Finally &#8211; I abandoned Daz Studio (which I would need to export a mesh) and fully embraced a Blender/makeHuman pipeline. I can now use the hair particle tools to make some pretty convincing looking hair.

The results I think are the best &#8211; not perfect but with a few tweaks could be pretty outstanding for this graphic novel.

And there we have it. A few interesting tests of different hair. I&#8217;m excited to see where I can take it from here!
