We&#8217;ve been quiet at the lab for a while. This is because we&#8217;re hard at work on bringing you, Interns, something fun!

Jon, a fellow Lab Tech here at CubeLab Media, has been hard at work building what we can only call a great beginners guide into building a simple game in Unity. He spent a few hours testing out his method and will be building this fantastic tutorial for your future consumption!

If you&#8217;ve not done it already, go over to our YouTube Channel and subscribe! We&#8217;re going to roll some great stuff out this fall and we don&#8217;t want you to miss it!

Jon is really excited to create this tutorial! Stay tuned, friends!
