The the recent weeks, my boys (Samurai Owl, Blackhole_50, Godzilla Dojo) have all taken to playing the (mostly) free online game Roblox.

It's not an altogether awesome system. Low (LOW LOW) poly graphics that are very akin to Minecraft and Legos. Slew of mini games created by users. 

I started playing with them. It's really fun to play games with some of the coolest kids on the planet. And we do, we've played a plethora of different games and had a great time. Yes, I had a great time.

So, with the encouragement of Samurai Owl, I started recording some of the game times. 

I present:

## Roblox Theater!

Not sure why theater, but it was a fun title that came to mind.

You can check out the first few episodes of Roblox Theater over at the youtube Channel for The Lab Cast.
