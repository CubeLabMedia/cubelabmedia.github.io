Today we began real work on a future game. We, as in friend, developer and fellow game addict, Jon Price. We met and sketched out and talked and worked out some preliminary specs for our first cooperative game, "Bitter Balloons". Coming soon to Android and iOS devices nearest to you!

We're really stoked about the prospects this brings.

Here are some pictures of an hour of discussion.
