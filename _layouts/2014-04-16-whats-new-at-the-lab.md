It's already a quarter through 2014 and there has been little or no news from the lab. It's as if a black hole spontaneously opened and sucked up all the projects, leaving no news or updates!

Well, in a way that is what happened. Minus the cosmic event.

Things of the personal nature has caused all the wonderful projects on the "to do" list to be pushed back. It's a bit frustrating, but that's life.

So, small updates per projects:
<h2>Deadland Chronicles</h2>
This project is huge. It's going to take some time. I'm tweaking, revisiting, tweaking, revisiting the script trying to get it right. It will come. What form, who knows. It could stay as a graphic novel/comic, be a written novel or hey, maybe an animated series. Time will tell. But this story is dear to me and won't be left alone for long.

<h2>Hello, Hydro</h2>
Mobile games are the future! And they're here today! Which, means .. they're really the present and ...

This is still in the works. I've been slowing building up my code base so when it comes time to rollin everything out I'll be on top of it. This will be primarily a game for your smartphones and tablets - so get your game face on.

<h2>Bitter Balloons</h2>
Oh, these darling little air filled bundles of grouchy joy!

We (Jon [Jerboa Studios] and Tadd) are still hard at work on this, but with time cut short by prior obligations we had to step back, take a breather and regroup. We're still excited for this project, we thing it's going to be one heck of a game! Who doesn't want to get rid of their grouchy little balloons!?

<h2>Other writings and games</h2>
OK, anyone who knows me(Tadd) knows I have dozens of ideas for other projects that I keep tucked away in what passes for my brain. Also, Evernote. So where are these in the greater scheme of things?

To be fair to the previously mentioned projects I'm putting a lot of my future dreams and aspirations on hold for now. Other than taking notes to expand whatever world I'm creating for said story. I love writing. I love exploring new possibilities. Until I have time, they'll have to be put on a shelf, only to be admired from afar.
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
So you see, the lab is still in full effect. However, 2014 has shown some unwanted surprises and we had to pull back a little before we're completely overwhelmed.

Our beakers are burning. The lab is still open.

Scientifically Yours,
Prof. Tadd
